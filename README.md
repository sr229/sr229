# Hello.world();

Hey, you're finally here. You were trying to find some sort of exhaustive resource about me? Cool! Then this README is designed for you to know how exactly I am.


## Who am I?

People usually call me as sr229, Capuccino, Enra, but I'm known here as Ayane Satomi. I'm a hobbyist coder since middle school and I've been working on stuff with Docker and Kubernetes for almost 3 years as a hobby.

While I don't have that much of professional experience, I'm eager to learn and I'm willing to solve problems and cooperate with everyone to move a project. 


## Have you done anything notable?

Nope! Though my pinned projects are my projects or the projects I've contributed to. I'm happy to make them or to be part of them, and would continue to do so. I enjoy making projects that makes me happy and makes everyone happy as well.


## Can I support you?

Of course! My official funding links are here:

- Stellar Network: `chinodesuuu*keybase.io` or `GB6R5VUMCUVMKZNWWZPH5TZ5BLKQ3KUPYERBUJTD4DMYBAX3GG7S2TX7`
- [CryptoPayment (For any other crypto)](https://vendor.cryptopayment.link/p/Ky12m78u)

Giving my projects stars also helps! It means a lot to me when people stop by and they think its excellent, so don't shy away giving stars if you think I'm doing well.
